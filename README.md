# OOCC - Object-to-Object Conformance Checking

## Overview
OOCC is a sophisticated software tool designed to compare and evaluate object-to-object relationships inferred from event occurrences with explicitly defined relationships within object-centric event logs (OCEL). The project aims to ensure the reliability and authenticity of analyses derived from object-centric event data by enabling a detailed comparison and visualization of relationships, utilizing precision and recall metrics for quantitative evaluation.

## Key Features
- **Data Processing:** Import, process, and derive relationships from event logs efficiently.
- **Conformance Comparison:** Compare inferred relationships against explicit relationships for alignment and deviations.
- **Visualization Module:** Create graphical representations to illustrate object-to-object relationships and discrepancies.
- **Precision and Recall Calculation:** Conduct quantitative assessment of precision and recall metrics for relationship accuracy.
- **Report / Export Module:** Export results and graphs for detailed analysis and reporting.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **Docker**
- **JavaScript Libraries:** React, D3.js
- **Web Framework:** Django

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://git.rwth-aachen.de/pooya_sh1998/oocc.git`
2. Set up the environment using Docker: `docker-compose up`
3. Access the application via a web browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage
1. Upload event logs using the provided interface.
2. Analyze conformance and discrepancies using the visualization module.
3. Export and share reports or graphs for further analysis.
For detailed information on installation and usage, please refer to the [User Manual](/UserManual.md).
